# Mechatronik-Workshop

Some arduino stuff for a workshop. Moving all motors on a scale from 0 to 100 within their boundaries works.

## Lightsearch

Searching for the brightest spot working (but really slow and not very smart.)

## Idea
Controlling the robot via Twitter API. Reading the Twitter API and extracting function with RegExp, communication between Processing and Arduino working (but not for specific things yet, just generally working.)
